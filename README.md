# Predicting heart disease using machine learning

- This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

### Problem Definition
- In a statement,
Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?
### Data
- The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease
- There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci
### Evaluation
- If we can reach 90% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.
